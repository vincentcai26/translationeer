# How To Guide

The basics of Translationeer to help you get started!

## Step 1: Open a Workspace

A Workspace where you can translate text using the Translationeer software tools. On the homepage, you can click on any of the workspace options to open a new workspace. You can open a blank workspace or have a common Latin text generated for you.

## Step 2: Set up the Workspace

You can select whether you would like to write or sight translate the text by using Writing or Sight Mode. You can also give the Workspace a custom title by clicking the pen icon next to the default workspace title. If you opened a blank Workspace, you can click the green edit icon on the first section of the Workspace and paste in a block of text you would like to translate.

You can at any time switch between Writing and Sight Mode by going into settings, by clicking on the gear icon above the main section of the Workspace.

## Step 3: Translate!

If you are using Writing Mode, you will see the original text on the left side, and you will write your translation on the right side. Start typing up a translation! 

If you are using Sight Mode, the original text will appear in the middle of the screen.

While translating, you will have access to all of Translationeer's tools to organize and help with your translation.

### Click on Words

Click on any word to view it's definition. Use your mouse to drag it around.

Make sure that in the page header, the language is correct and your desired translators are turned on. You can toggle what language and what translators to use in the page header, default language is "Latin to English".

Click the pen icon to edit the word to lookup. When editing, you can highlight text in the definition and you cannot drag.

### Select Text and Break Off Text

Select some text. On the Workspace header, there will be a button to "Break Off Text". Click on this button and the selected text will be broken up into it's own separate section. 

Select and break off sections of text to organize your translation into logical and manageable pieces!

### Merge Sections

Once you have broken up your Workspace into separate sections, click the small button (with the two small arrows) in the middle of two of the sections to merge them together. 

Merging will combine both text and translation of two adjacent sections. Merging cannot be undone.

Click the small "+" button at the end of the translation to add on another section at the end.

### Edit Text

For each section, click the green edit icon on the left side to edit the original text. Click "Done" to confirm the changes.

### Settings and Display

Near the top right corner of the page, click the gear icon. Here you can toggle Workspace settings, like how you want your page to be displayed.

## Step 4: Copy Your Translation!

After you're done translating, it's time to copy your translation to your clipboard!

Near the top right corner of the screen, right next to the settings icon, click the word "Copy". 

Now go paste your translation wherever you want!
