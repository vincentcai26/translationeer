## Breaking Off Text

Select any text from the left side to break it off into it's separate section. Common use cases include translating by sentence, line, paragraph or stanza.

An excerpt of the selected text will show in the Workspace Header, and a button will appear that says "break off text". Click this button to break the text off into it's own separate section.

Line breaks and spaces are supported for breaking off text.

When selected text is broken off, the selected text will be it's own section. If there is a portion of text before or after the selected text, that text will be in it's own section. This way, if the text is broken off in the middle of a section, there will be three sections created from one original section. If the selected text is at the beginning or end of the original section, two sections will be created.

### For Translations in Writing Mode

If there is a translation written for a section that is split up by breaking off text, the entire translation will go in the **first section** of the resulting sections from the breaking off of the text. 

For example, if there are 4 sections in a Workspace, and you break off text from the middle of the 2nd section, there will be 6 sections after you break off the text. The translation written for the original 2nd section will stay in the 2nd section, while the newly created 3rd and 4th sections will have an empty translation.

Please note that if breaking off text produces a section is just one character or a few spaces of text, Translationeer may automatically remove that section.

## Merging and Adding Sections

Merging sections refers to the process of combining the original texts and translations of two adjacent sections into one. 

Click the small button between the left and right sides and between the two sections you want to merge to merge the sections. The button will have two small arrows. 

Merging cannot be undone.

In Writing Mode, the texts and translations of the two sections will be placed right after each other in the new combined section.

You can also add a section by clicking the "+" button at the end of the Workspace, also between the left and right sides. This will create a new section at the end of Workspace with blank text (and blank translation in Writing Mode).

## Editing Text

In Writing Mode, you may freely edit the translation of every section (the right side).

To edit the original text, the text in Sight Mode and the left side in Writing Mode, click on the green edit icon in the top right corner of the original text section. Now you can freely edit the text. Click either "Done" or "cancel" to keep or discard the changes. Please note that you cannot break off text in a section when you are editing the left side.
