# Definitions

Links to definitions are shown in popups. Each popup can be dragged around using your mouse.  

On the top of a definiton popup, the word being looked up is shown, as well as a pen icon that can be clicked to edit the word. When the word is being edited, the popup cannot be dragged and text can be highlighted in the popup. Click the search icon to update with the edited word. All definition links of the word will automatically be updated.

The popup will show links to definitions from each of the enabled translators shown in the page header. The word will be looked up in the language specified in the page header. You can change the language or the enabled translators by hovering over them in the page header and clicking on the desired ones. When the language is changed, the translators list will be updated and the defintion links updated automatically. When new translators are enabled, the word will be looked up in that new translator. 

Please note that some special characters in Latin, in particular long vowels, are escaped to as just regular vowels when generating the definition link to a certain word.
