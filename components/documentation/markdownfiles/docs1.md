# General Usage

Translationeer is designed for those who translate texts and literature from languages other than English to and from English. It is accessible as a website over the internet and can also be downloaded. Currently it only supports Latin.

Users create workspaces, from either a pre-made template or a blank workspace to fill in, to translate a piece of text. Users can divide the sections how they wish and click on words in the text to lookup their definitions. Text can be selected and broken off into its own separate section, and sections can be added or merged together. Commonly, a piece of text that is to be translated is pasted into a Translationeer workspace, is then translated using the Translationeer software tools, and is then copied and pasted somewhere.
