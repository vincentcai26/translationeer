# Workspace

A Translationeer Workspace can be opened on the homepage from a specific template, or can be blank. A Workspace can be accessed at `/workspace/[template]`, depending on the template you used to create it, and it will only persist for the browser session. After you close the tab, or click away from the Workspace page, the Workspace will be gone. Data in Workspaces are not saved.

## Layout

A Workspace can be shown in two different modes: Writing Mode and Sight Mode. Writing Mode is made for writing a translation side-by-side, while Sight Mode is for sight translation and/or any translation that is not written. You can switch freely between the two modes in the Workspace settings.

A popup will show when a workspace is opened, asking if you want to use Writing Mode or Sight Mode. You may click on either option to switch to that layout, or close the popup to continue with the default Writing Mode.

### Writing Mode

In Writing Mode, a Workspace will have the original text on the left side (grey background) and space for the user's translation on the right side. Each section of the Workspace will have both an original text and a user written translation.

### Sight Mode 

In Sight Mode, the text to be translated will show in the center of the page. Each section will only have text.

### General Layout

Workspaces are divided into multiple sections. A Workspace first created will have one section, the text being inputed from the dashboard or generate from a test template. You have the ability to easily create more sections.

The very top of the page there is the header, where you can toggle the language (in light blue, by default "Latin to English") and the translators. These will be useful for defintion lookups. You can also click the user icon (if authenticated) to go back to the dashboard, or links to the How to Guide and Documentation. Note that clicking any link will direct to another page, so make sure your Workspace is saved.

You will see the name of the Workspace at the top, and then a thin Workspace Header with a few icons. Below you will see the body of the Workspace.

## Name

Click on the pen icon on the right side of the name to edit the name. When done editing, click the checkmark.

## Copying Text

Only the translation in Writing Mode can be automatically copied to the clipboard. 

Click the "Copy" text on the right of the Workspace Header to copy all sections of your translation (the right side) to your clipboard. The text will say "Copied" if successful or "Error" if unsuccessful. You can change how to divide sections in the copied text in [Settings](/documentation/settings)
